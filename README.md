# seedsplit
Seedsplit lets you split a mnemonic seed into a selected number of shards which are also encoded as mnemonics. n-of-m shards can then be combined in order to get the initial mnemonic seed. This is accomplished by using Shamirs Secret Sharing.

# Tests
To run tests:
```
$ npm test
```

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to Christian Lundkvist for the idea of using encoded the shards to mnemonics.
